Remove use of -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 from the generated
configure script.

The current versions of mingw-w64 have gained support for
-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE now, but when using it, the built project
needs to manually specify -lssp to link successfully.

Just remove this option to avoid having to pass that linker option,
achieving no worse level of security as with earlier versions of
mingw-w64.
